# HSRVote_XML-Converter
Creates a file filled with nwiki-formatted data converted from a xml-file

## How to use the script:
- Put your xml-file in the same directory in which the script ```voteConverter.py``` is.
- The xml-file should be encoded with "UTF-8" or "UTF-8-BOM"
- Run the script
- In the console, write the name of your xml-file.
- It creates a file with the same name but as a txt-file. If such a file already exists, it'll get overwritten.
- Copy all the text from that file.
- On your moodle-site, go to your wiki or create a new one.
- Paste the data on a new page (nwiki-format) and save.
