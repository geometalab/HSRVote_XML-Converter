# HSRVote_XML-Converter
Creates a file filled with nwiki-formatted data converted from a xml-file

## How to use the script:
- Put your xml-file in the same directory in which the script ```voteConverter.py``` is.
- The xml-file should be encoded with "UTF-8" or "UTF-8-BOM"
- If you have Python 3 or higher, run the script ```voteConverter.py```
- If you have Python 2, run the script ```voteConverter2.py```
- The script needs additional arguments to do its work. Simply run the script to see how.
- If done correctly, there should be a new .nwiki-file in the directory.
- Copy all the text from that file.
- On your moodle-site, go to your wiki or create a new one.
- Paste the data on a new page (nwiki-format) and save.
