# HSRVote_XML-Converter
Creates a file filled with nwiki-formatted data converted from a HSRVote XML file

## How to use the script:
*note: You need Python 3 to use the script*
- Your XML file should be encoded with "UTF-8" or "UTF-8-BOM"
- Run the script `voteConverter.py`
- The script needs additional arguments to do its work. Simply run the script to see how.
- If done correctly, there should be a new file (ending in `.nwiki` by default) in the directory of the XML file.
- Copy all the text from that file.
- On your moodle site, go to your wiki or create a new one.
- Paste the data on a new page (nwiki format) and save.
