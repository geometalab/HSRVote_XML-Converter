# HSRVote_XML-Converter
Creates a file filled with nwiki-formatted data converted from a xml-file

## How to use the script:
- Put your xml-file in the same directory in which the script ```voteConverter.py``` is.
- Run the script, with the name of your xml-file as an argument: "python voteConverter.py BspFragen.xml"
- It creates a file named "wikitext.txt". If such a file already exists, it'll get overwritten.
- Copy all the text from that file.
- On your moodle-site, go to your wiki or create a new one.
- Paste the data on a new page (nwiki-format) and save.
